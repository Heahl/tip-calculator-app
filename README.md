# Tip Calculator App

Simple App that lets the user calculate the Tip Amount per person and the Total per person based on the Bill, the selected Tip, and the number of people.
Design is by Frontend Mentor.

+ bill amount input field functions like the one of paypal (just type, dot is inserted automatically)
+ instead of letting the user run into errors, the goal was to prevent them to improve UX (reduce frustration)
